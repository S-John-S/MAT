<h1>MAT</h1> 
    online at : http://mat-online.herokuapp.com
A few changes caused an error so now the site has been rollbacked to last working form
Professional site skeleton
There are now 6 pages :-
<h2>Home</h2>
    This will contain High resolution pictures of proteins(or something similar), all links to navigate through the website, and news and annoucements. Footer shows the meta perspective of the project. 
<h2>MAT Gateway</h2>
    This where the user will upload the file and choose what all features to be used to process the file and provide the results on a new page in systematic manner.
<h2>Other pages   //Under construction </h2>
    These will be content rich and would also provide the open source stuff that the project contributors made.
